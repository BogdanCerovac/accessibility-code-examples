# Success Criterion 1.4.2 - Audio Control

Always offer a pause or stop button when playing sound.

On Android, MediaPlayer has methods to [start](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer#start()), [pause](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer#pause()) and [stop](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer#stop()).

```kotlin
button.setOnClickListener {
    if (player.isPlaying()) {
        player.pause() // Or: player.stop()
    } else {
        player.start()
    }
}
```

Tip: make sure that sound is played through the correct channel. Use the [AudioManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager) for this. The following channels are available:

- [STREAM_ACCESSIBILITY](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_ACCESSIBILITY): channel for accessibility, such as assistive technologies
- [STREAM_ALARM](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_ALARM): channel for alarms
- [STREAM_DMTF](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_DTMF): channel for dual-tone multi-frequency signaling, such as phone dialing tones
- [STREAM_MUSIC](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_MUSIC): channel for music
- [STREAM_NOTIFICATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_NOTIFICATION): channel for notifications
- [STREAM_RING](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_RING): channel for incoming phone calls
- [STREAM_SYSTEM](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_SYSTEM): channel for system sounds
- [STREAM_VOICE_CALL](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_VOICE_CALL): channel for voice calls
