# Success Criterion 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold

On Android, flashing content often uses [Executors](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/Executors), [Handler](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler), or [Timer](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Timer). Check if these objects are used to show more than three flashes per second. Also check if more than three flashes per second are shown in videos.
