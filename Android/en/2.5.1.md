# Success Criterion 2.5.1 - Pointer Gestures

On Android, the [GestureDetector](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/GestureDetector) is often used in combination with an [OnGestureListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/GestureDetector.OnGestureListener) to detect gestures.

A gesture should not be the only way to trigger actions. Make sure to add a second way, such as a button, to trigger the same action.
