# Success Criterion 2.5.4 Motion Actuation

On Android, the [SensorManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager) is often used in combination with a [SensorEventListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEventListener) to detect movement.
