# Success Criterion 1.1.1 - Non-text Content

With Flutter, a `label` or `attributedLabel` from the [Semantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html) widget can be used. Here, `label` is spoken by the screen reader and `attributedLabel` can be used for more control over how it should be pronounced, for example by spelling a range with [SpellOutStringAttribute](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/SpellOutStringAttribute-class.html) or forcing another language with [LocaleStringAttribute](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/LocaleStringAttribute-class.html).

```dart
Semantics(
  label: 'Name',
  child: ListTile(...);
);
```
