# Success Criterion 1.2.1 - Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)

With Flutter, you are able to use [Text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html) to display written text. Make sure to wrap the `Text` widget in a [SingleChildScrollView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleChildScrollView-class.html) and to set the overflow parameter to `TextOverflow.visible`. Also, the `softwrap` parameter needs to be true to prevent the text from overflowing outside its container. 

```dart
SingleChildScrollView(
  child: Text(
    'Very long text as an example',
    softWrap: true,
    overflow: TextOverflow.visible,
  ),
),
```
