# Success Criterion 1.2.4 - Captions (Live)

Currently, there is no support for live captions in the [video_player](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player) package. The issue opened to implement this is [#50595](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/50595).

Other packages, like [better_player](https://pub.dev/packages/better_player), do have support for using captions on live video. See their [documentation](https://jhomlala.github.io/betterplayer/#/README) for extensive information about `better_player`

```dart
BetterPlayerController controller = BetterPlayerController(
    const BetterPlayerConfiguration(
      controlsConfiguration: BetterPlayerControlsConfiguration(
        enableAudioTracks: true,
        enableSubtitles: true,
      ),
    ),
    betterPlayerDataSource: BetterPlayerDataSource.network(
      'https://live.video', 
      liveStream: true,
      useAsmsSubtitles: true,
    ),
  );


@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return BetterPlayer(controller: controller);
}
```
