# Success Criterion 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships

With Flutter, accessibility properties are automatically created for a number of widgets, such as `Slider`, `Button`, `CheckBox` and `TextField`. This ensures that a lot of things work automatically, although it remains important that you also test this.

It is possible to get an overview of all `AccessibilityNodes` by running `flutter run` in the terminal and then typing `S` or `U`. The option `S` gives the order which is used by assistive technologies. The option `U` prints the nodes in an inverse hit-test order.

To make a Flutter app accessible it is important to use the standard Flutter widgets and themes. For example, a `TextButton` automatically has the button property.

When the accessibility properties of a widget do not show the desired behavior, it is possible to supplement or overwrite this. This is possible with the [Semantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html) widget. The most common properties here are `header`, `image`, `link`, `sortKey`, `container` and `excludeSemantics`. The other options are described in [SemanticsProperties](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties-class.html).

- [header](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties/header.html)
  - The `header` property can be used to indicate that all child widgets are a header.

- [image](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties/image.html)
  - The `image` property specifies that all child widgets are an image.

- [sortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties/sortKey.html)
  - `sortKey`  uses a [SemanticsSortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsSortKey-class.html) to sort the elements. The most common way to sort elements is the [OrdinalSortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/OrdinalSortKey-class.html), but you can also write your own implementation based on the `SemanticsSortKey` class.

    The `OrdinalSortKey` needs an `order` as double and an optional String `name`. The elements are then sorted by name first, with empty names handled first, and then by `order`.

    It is also possible not to provide a `sortKey`. In that case, Flutter will generate `OrdinalSortKey`'s based on a platform specific algorithm. This order is often a fairly logical order, but this does not guarantee that it is always right. So always make sure that the sequence is properly tested by means of a screen reader and create a different sequence yourself if necessary.

- [container](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics/container.html)
  - `container` can be used to create a new `SemanticsNode`. This ensures that the information is not merged with parent widgets. This prevents inheriting behavior as Text in a TextButton.  This can also be prevented by setting the `explicitChildNodes` property to `true` in the parent widget.

- [excludeSemantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics/excludeSemantics.html)
  - This property can be used to specify that all child SemanticNodes should be ignored. Considering using [ExcludeSemantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ExcludeSemantics-class.html) when you only need this property. You can also achieve this behavior with [BlockSemantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BlockSemantics-class.html) by removing a previous SemanticsNode.
