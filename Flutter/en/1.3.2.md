# Success Criterion 1.3.2 - Meaningful Sequence

With Flutter, the accessibility traversal order in Flutter is assumed automatically based on a platform-specific algorithm. This usually results in a quite good traversal order, but it sometimes might be needed to define a specific order. This can be achieved by using the [Semantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html) widget with a [OrdinalSortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/OrdinalSortKey-class.html).

The `OrdinalSortKey` is used to traverse over widgets in a certain order. The traversal order is defined by sorting the keys based on the `name` value with the empty values first and then the `order` value defined as a `double`.
