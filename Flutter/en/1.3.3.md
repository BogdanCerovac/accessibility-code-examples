# Success Criterion 1.3.3 - Sensory Characteristics

With Flutter, it is possible to use the [Semantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html) widget to add more information to certain widgets in your application. To provide users with information about context actions the `hint` or `attributedHint` values can be used to describe what the result of the action will be. 

To implement specific functionality for assistive technologies it is possible to add a `onTap`, `onLongPress` or other callbacks to the `Semantics` widget. In this case it is important to make sure the child nodes do not implement a touch listener, or to use `excludeSemantics` to ignore these with the assistive technologies. 

```dart
Semantics(
  button: true,
  hint: 'Action description',
  onTap: () {
    // Custom onTap handle
  },
  excludeSemantics: true,
  child: TextButton(...),
);
```
