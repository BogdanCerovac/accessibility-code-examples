# Success Criterion 1.3.5 - Identify Input Purpose

With Flutter, it is possible to define the type of input needed for a [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html) of [TextFormField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextFormField-class.html) by using both `autoFillHints` and `keyboardType`.

`keyboardType` accepts a [TextInputType](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/TextInputType-class.html) and changes the keyboard layout accordingly. The following layouts are available in Flutter:

- text: Optimized for text input.
- multiline: Optimized for multiline text input, by having an enter key.
- number: Optimized for unsigned numerical input.
- numberWithOptions: Optimized for numerical input.
- phone: Number keyboard with '*' and '#'.
- emailAddress: Keyboard optimized for entering e-mail addresses.
- url: Optimized keyboard for entering URLs with '/' and '.'.
- visiblePassword: Keyboard with letters and numbers.
- streetAddress: Optimized for entering addresses, iOS displays default keyboard.
- datetime: Keyboard optimized for entering date and time, iOS displays default keyboard.
- name: Keyboard optimized for inputting a person's name
- none: Prevents the OS from displaying a keyboard.

`autoFillHints` is used to set a desired input and tell the operating system what type of suggestions to give the user. The field supports one of the values of the [AutofillHints-class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/AutofillHints-class.html). If it exists, each of the values in this class will be translated to a corresponding Android/iOS input type. Refer to the documentation in the [flutter source code](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter/lib/src/services/autofill.dart) to see what platforms are supported and what the behaviour will be on each platform, as the documentation for the platform specific behaviour is linked to each entry.
