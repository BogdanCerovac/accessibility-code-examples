# Success Criterion 1.4.10 - Reflow

With Flutter, all elements must be placed in a scalable widget. A [SingleChildScrollView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleChildScrollView-class.html) ensures that the underlying widgets that do not fit on the screen become scrollable. In addition, it is important not to set `maxLines` anywhere. Also avoid using fixed values for set heights, unless their content is in a SingleChildScrollView.

In addition, use `TextOverflow.visible` with the `overflow` parameter of text fields to ensure that the text is not truncated.
