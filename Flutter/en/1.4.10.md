# Success Criterion 1.4.10 - Reflow

With Flutter, all elements should be placed in a scalable widget. A [SingleChildScrollView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleChildScrollView-class.html) ensures that the underlying widgets that do not fit on the screen become scrollable.

In addition, it is important to avoid setting `maxLines` anywhere. Also avoid using fixed values for heights, unless the widgets are containd inside a SingleChildScrollView.

Furthermore, use `TextOverflow.visible` with the `overflow` parameter of text fields to ensure that the text is not truncated.
