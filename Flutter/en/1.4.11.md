# Success Criterion 1.4.11 - Non-text Contrast

When designing an app, take the contrast ratio of all content into account. The contrast ratio should be at least 3:1.

You can take a screenshot of the app to determine colors and calculate contrast using an online contrast calculator, as there are no plugins or tools to check this with using Flutter.
