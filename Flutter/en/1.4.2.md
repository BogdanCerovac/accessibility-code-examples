# Success Criterion 1.4.2 - Audio Control

A best practice is to always provide a pause or stop button when sound is playing.

To play sound in Flutter a package is needed, there are a few options out to chose from, but [just_audio](https://pub.dev/packages/just_audio) is by far the most popular.

The `AudioPlayer` class has functions for both starting and pausing the audio, being `play()` and `pause()`.

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: Icon(Icons.play_arrow),
  iconSize: 64.0,
  onPressed: player.play,
);
/// or
IconButton(
  icon: Icon(Icons.pause),
  iconSize: 64.0,
  onPressed: player.pause,
);
```
