# Success Criterion 1.4.4 - Resize text

Flutter automatically scales the text on the screen to the text size set by the user. We do recommend using [ThemeData](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData-class.html) to use the same text sizes and fonts everywhere.

It is possible to override the scaling of the text by using the `textScaleFactor` parameter. 1.0 is the standard factor here. This can be done with a part of the application by using [MediaQuery](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQuery-class.html) or with a single text with [Text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html).

```dart
MediaQuery(
  data: MediaQuery.of(context).copyWith(
    textScaleFactor: 1.0,
  ),
  child: ..., // Widget waarop dit van toepassing moet zijn
);
```

```dart
Text(
  'Tekst', 
  textScaleFactor: 1.0,
),
```
