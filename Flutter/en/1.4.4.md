# Success Criterion 1.4.4 - Resize text

Flutter automatically scales the text on the screen to the text size set by the user. We recommend using [ThemeData](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData-class.html) to use the same text sizes and fonts everywhere.

It is possible to override the scaling of the text by using the `textScaleFactor` parameter. The default factor is `1.0`. Use [MediaQuery](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQuery-class.html) to override this value globally. Or override it for a single case by using the property inside a [Text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html) widget.

```dart
MediaQuery(
  data: MediaQuery.of(context).copyWith(
    textScaleFactor: 1.0,
  ),
  child: ..., // Widget to apply textScaleFactor to
);
```

```dart
Text(
  'Appt', 
  textScaleFactor: 1.0,
),
```
