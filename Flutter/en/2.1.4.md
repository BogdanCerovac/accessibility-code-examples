# Success Criterion 2.1.4 - Character Key Shortcuts

Flutter gives the ability to add a listener to the [RawKeyboard](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/RawKeyboard-class.html). By adding a listener it is possible to implement shortcuts within the application. `RawKeyboard` yields a [RawKeyUpEvent](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/RawKeyUpEvent-class.html) of a [RawKeyDownEvent](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/RawKeyDownEvent-class.html). The `data` attribute has a `isModifierPressed()` method that can be used to determine whether a modifier key has been pressed.

```dart
RawKeyboard.instance.addListener((keyEvent) {
  if (keyEvent is RawKeyUpEvent) {
    if (keyEvent.logicalKey == LogicalKeyboardKey.keyF &&
        keyEvent.data.isModifierPressed(ModifierKey.controlModifier)) {
      findContent();
    }
  }
});

void findContent() {
  // Logic to find content
}
```
