# Success Criterion 2.2.1 - Timing Adjustable

With Flutter, a [SnackBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SnackBar-class.html) is often used to provide users with some information. The message might be displayed for a too short period of time for users to read or hear the message. 

We recommend displaying messages by using an [AlertDialog](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AlertDialog-class.html) with a close button, or to add a close button to the `Snackbar` and set the duration to infinite.

Also make sure that the use of time limits, e.g. by using `Future.delayed()`, throughout the application are extendable. 

```dart
ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(
  duration: const Duration(days: 365),
  content: Text('Message'),
  action: SnackBarAction(
    label: 'Close',
    onPressed: () {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).hideCurrentSnackBar();
    },
  ),
));
```
