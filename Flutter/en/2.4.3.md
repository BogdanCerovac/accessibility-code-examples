# Success Criterion 2.4.3 - Focus Order

For sorting the focus order in Flutter apps, the `sortKey` parameter of [Semantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties-class.html) is used.

This parameter uses a [SemanticsSortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsSortKey-class.html) to sort the elements. The most common way to sort elements is the [OrdinalSortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/OrdinalSortKey-class.html), but you can also write your own implementation based on the `SemanticsSortKey` class.

The `OrdinalSortKey` needs an `order` as double and optionally a `name` as String. The elements are then sorted by name, with empty names handled first, and subsequently by `order`.

It is also possible to not provide a `sortKey`. In this case, Flutter will generate `OrdinalSortKey`'s based on a platform specific algorithm. This order is often a fairly logical order, but this does not guarantee that it is always right. Always make sure to verify the the sequence with assistive technologies such as the screen reader.
