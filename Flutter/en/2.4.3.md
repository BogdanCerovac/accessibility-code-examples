# Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order

For sorting the focus order in Flutter apps, the `sortKey` parameter of [Semantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties-class.html) is used.
This parameter uses a [SemanticsSortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsSortKey-class.html) to sort the elements. The most common way to sort elements is the [OrdinalSortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/OrdinalSortKey-class.html), but you can also write your own implementation based on the `SemanticsSortKey` class.

The `OrdinalSortKey` needs an `order` as double and an optional String `name`. The elements are then sorted by name first, with empty names handled first, and then by `order`.

It is also possible not to provide a `sortKey`. In that case, Flutter will generate `OrdinalSortKey`'s based on a platform specific algorithm. This order is often a fairly logical order, but this does not guarantee that it is always right. So always make sure that the sequence is properly tested by means of a screen reader and create a different sequence yourself if necessary.
