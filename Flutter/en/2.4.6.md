# Success Criterion 2.4.6 - Headings and Labels

Make sure you use clear headings: think about this carefully during the design phase. Don't forget to mark these headings for assistive technologies, you can read how to do that in [success criterion 1.3.1](1.3.1.md).

With Flutter it is possible to add labels to a [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html) by adding a [InputDecoration](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/InputDecoration-class.html) to the `decoration` parameter and defining its `labelText` attribute.

```dart
return const TextField(
      decoration: InputDecoration(
        labelText: 'Label Text',
        hintText: 'Hint Text',
        helperText: 'Helper Text',
      ),
    );
```
