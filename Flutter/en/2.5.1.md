# Success Criterion 2.5.1 - Pointer Gestures

With Flutter, it is possible to use a [GestureDetector](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html) to implement actions based on certain gestures made.

However, this should not be the only way to trigger an action. Make sure to add a second way, such as a button, to trigger the same action.
