# Success Criterion 2.5.2 - Pointer Cancellation

When using a [GestureDetector](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html) in Flutter avoid using the `onDown`, like `onTapDown` and `onLongPressDown`, listeners as the user will not be able to cancel the touch. Instead, use the `onAction` methods, like `onTap` or `onLongPress`, as these will give the user the option to cancel unintended actions.
