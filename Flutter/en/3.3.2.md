# Success Criterion 3.3.2 - Labels or Instructions

With Flutter, using an [InputDecoration](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/InputDecoration-class.html) with a [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html) the `helperText` parameter of `InputDecoration` can be used to display instructions for a [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html). An extra boolean can be used to switch between showing and hiding the instruction.

```dart
bool _showHelperText = false;

TextField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    helperText: _showHelperText ? 'Fill in all of the names that you have been given' : null,
  ),
);
```
