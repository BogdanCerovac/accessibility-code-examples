# Success Criterion 4.1.3 - Status Messages

With Flutter, messages provided by widgets such as `SnackBar` are automatically announced.

For passing messages to assistive technologies, it is possible to use the [announce](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsService/announce.html) method of [SemanticsService](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsService-class.html).

```dart
SemanticsService.announce('Appt', TextDirection.ltr);
```

It is also possible to use the `liveRegion` attribute of Semantics. This ensures that when the value changes, it is announced to assistive technologies.

The example belows shows you how to announce a `Stream<int>` which increases it's value.

```dart
Semantics(
  liveRegion: true,
  child: StreamBuilder<int>(
      stream: countStream, // Counts each five seconds
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.data == null) { // Shows nothing when the stream is empty
          return const SizedBox.shrink();
        } else  {
          return Text(snapshot.requireData.toString());
        }
      },
    ),
);
```
