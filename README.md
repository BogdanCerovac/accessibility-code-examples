# Accessibility code examples for mobile apps

This repository contains accessibility code examples for Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native and Xamarin apps.

The primary goal of this repostory is to provide code examples for each Success Criterion of the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/). In addition, there are also other code examples that improve accessibility.

Except as otherwise noted, code examples are licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and content is licensed under the [CC BY 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

In the future, these code examples will be published on [appt.org](https://appt.org), an international platform for app accessibility. The platform is currently in development and will go live before the end of 2022.
