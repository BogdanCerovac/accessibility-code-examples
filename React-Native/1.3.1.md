# Success Criterion 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships

## Info
In React Native there are multiple properties you can add to your element to give more info about the element:
- [`accessibilityLabel`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitylabel) to give some information about the element, for example a name.
- [`accessibilityHint`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityhint) to help the user understand what will happen after performing an action on the element.
- [`accessibilityRole`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityhint) to set the purpose of the element, for example a button.
- [`accessibilityState`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitystate) to communicate the state of the element to the user, for example if it is disabled.
- [`accessibilityValue`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityvalue) to communicate the current value of the element.

```jsx
<Pressable
  accessibilityLabel="Close"
  accessibilityHint="Close modal"
  accessibilityRole="button"
  accessibilityState={{disabled: true}}
  accessibilityValue={{text: 'Current value'}}
/>
```

## Relations
In React Native it's possible to group elements together to a single selectable element. The property [`accessible`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessible) is used for this. Don't forget to add information to this element to communicate to the user what it is, for example with the [`accessibilityLabel`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitylabel).

```jsx
<View accessible accessibilityLabel="Text component">
  <Text>text one</Text>
  <Text>text two</Text>
</View>
```

Note: by default, all touchable elements are accessible.
