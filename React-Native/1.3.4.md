# Success Criterion 1.3.4 - Orientation

Multiple screen orientations should work fine by default. But be careful when using the [Dimensions API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/dimensions). Use the provided [useWindowDimensions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/usewindowdimensions) hook or make sure you don't cache Dimension values but retreive them on every render.

Note: Screen orientation in React Native is handled in the native code.
See [Orientation in Android](./../Android/1.3.4.md) and [Orientation in iOS](./../iOS/1.3.4.md) how to make sure all orientations are enabled on both platforms.
