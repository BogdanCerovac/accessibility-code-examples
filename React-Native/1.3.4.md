# Success Criterion 1.3.4 - Orientation

Screen orientation in React Native is handled in the native code.
See [Orientation in Android](./../Android/1.3.4.md) and [Orientation in iOS](./../iOS/1.3.4.md) how to make sure all orientations are enabled on both platforms.

Note: Multiple screen orientations should work fine by default unless you're using [Dimensions API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/dimensions) and don't handle orientation changes.
