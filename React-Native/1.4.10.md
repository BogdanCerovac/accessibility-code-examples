# Success Criterion 1.4.10 - Reflow

In React Native your elements should be inside a [ScrollView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview). If the elements don't fit, the view becomes scrollable so the user can still reach them.

Don't use fixed heights or widths on elements that have text in them to make sure text stays visible.

Avoid [`numberOfLines`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text#numberoflines) on text elements to prevent the text from being shortened.
