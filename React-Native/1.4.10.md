# Success Criterion 1.4.10 - Reflow

In React Native your elements should be inside a [ScrollView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview). If the elements don't fit the view becomes scrollable so the user can still reach them. Make sure you don't use fixed heights so the elements inside stay visible.

Avoid [numberOfLines](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text#numberoflines) on text elements to prevent the text from being shortened.
