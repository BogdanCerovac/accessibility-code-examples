# Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order

In React Native you can use the [`accessible`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessible) prop to indicate that a view should be focusable. The child elements get grouped together.

Unfortunately it's not possible to change the focus order. The official discussion on this topic can be found here: https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/389.
