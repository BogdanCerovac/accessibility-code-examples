# Success Criterion 4.1.3 - Status Messages
In React Native you can use the [`announceForAccessibility`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibilityinfo#announceforaccessibility) method from the AccessibilityInfo API. The message you pass to this method will be announced by the screenreader.

```js
AccessibilityInfo.setAccessibilityFocus('Announcement!');
```

// TODO: test if this actually works, should we add live regions?
