# Success Criterion 5 - Set accessibility focus

When you open a new element on top of your current content, for example a modal, you want to shift focus so the user can navigate through the content of this element. In React Native you can use the [`setAccessibilityFocus`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibilityinfo#setaccessibilityfocus) method from the AccessibilityInfo API. You can find the `reactTag` to pass to the `setAccessibilityFocus` method by calling `findNodeHandle`.

```jsx
const MyView = () => {
	const myElement = useRef();
	const reactTag = findNodeHandle(myElement.current);

	if (reactTag) {
		AccessibilityInfo.setAccessibilityFocus(reactTag);
	}


	return <View ref={myElement} />
};
```
