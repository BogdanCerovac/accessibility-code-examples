# Add accessibility action

In React Native it's possible to add alternative actions for assistive technology. We need to add two properties to the element to support these [`accessibility actions`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibility-actions): `accessibilityActions` and `onAccessibilityAction`.

```jsx
```


// TODO:
- Test this
- Explain about standard actions + example
- Explain about custom actions - how do these work? + example
