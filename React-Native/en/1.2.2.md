# [Success Criterion 1.2.2 - Captions (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html)

[React-Native-Video](https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video/blob/master/API.md#texttracks) supports captions in `.vtt`, `.ttml` and `.srt` formats. It is advised to use`.vtt` as it is supported on both Android and iOS. 

```jsx
import { TextTrackType, Video } from 'react-native-video';

<Video
    textTracks={[
        {
            title: "English CC",
            language: "en",
            type: TextTrackType.VTT,
            uri: "https://example.com/subtitles/en.srt"
        },
        {
            title: "Spanish Subtitles",
            language: "es",
            type: TextTrackType.SRT,
            uri: require('src/subtitles/es.srt')
        }
    ]}
/>
```
