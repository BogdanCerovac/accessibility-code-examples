# [Success Criterion 1.3.5 - Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html)

Making sure your input fields have the correct type will greatly increase the app's usability as the OS can assist users and adapt to the context.
A common example is adding the [`keyboardType`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput#keyboardtype) type to a text input, so that the app knows which keyboard to show.

```jsx
    <TextInput keyboardType='phone-pad' returnKeyType='search'/>
```

React Native offers many properties for the TextInput, but it is important to keep in mind that [not all values are cross-platform](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput#returnkeytype). Make sure to support both platforms properly to leverage the most from assistive technologies.


The Text element also has multiple accessibility values that can be used to offer extra context to users using assistive technologies.
For example setting [accessibilityRole](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text#accessibilityrole) to `link` can allow the screenreader to know that a text should be handled as a link.

```jsx    
<Pressable onPress={() => Linking.openURL('https://www.w3.org/')}>
      <Text accessibilityRole="link">Open</Text>
</Pressable>
```

On iOS there are very many [`textContentType` properties](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput#textcontenttype-ios) that help the user and the assistive technologies determine how to handle inputs. Making sure these are correct will greatly improve the UX of your app.

```jsx
const [userName, setUsername] = useState('');
const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
const [newPassword, setNewPassword] = useState('');

const updatePassword = () => API.updatePassword(username, password, newPassword);

<View>
      <TextInput textContentType="userName" value={userName} onChangeText={setUsername}/>
      <TextInput textContentType="password" value={password} onChangeText={setPassword}/>
      <TextInput textContentType="newPassword" value={newPassword} onSubmitEditing={updatePassword}/>
</View>
```
