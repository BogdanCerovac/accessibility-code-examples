# [Success Criterion 1.4.11 - Non-text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html)

When designing an app, take the contrast ratio of all content into account. The contrast ratio should be at least 3:1.

You can use [Accessibility inspector](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/OSXAXTestingApps.html) for iOS and [Accessibility Scanner for Android](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6376570?hl=en) to test non-text contrast and much other accessibility related issues.
