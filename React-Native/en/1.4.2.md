# [Success Criterion 1.4.2 - Audio Control](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-control.html)

When playing sound it is imperative that a user can control the audio by pausing and starting it.

In order to do this you can use the [`react-native-video` package with the `audioOnly` property enabled](https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video/blob/master/API.md#audioonly). Out of the box `react-native-video` will offer the use all the native controls required

```jsx
<Video audioOnly post={require('ally_image.jpeg')} source={require('ally.mp3')} />
```
