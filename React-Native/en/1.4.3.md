# [Success Criterion 1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)

Having sufficient text contrast ratio in an app is extremely important and very simple to achieve. Designers will usually take this into account when designing the app. The contrast ratio of text should be at least 4,5:1, or 3:1 for large text.

You can manually test the contrast of your app with [XCode's Accessibility Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/OSXAXTestingApps.html) and Android's [Accessibility Scanner](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/testing#accessibility-scanner). 

Android also offers a very useful [Pre-Launch Report](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/testing#pre-launch-report) that will highlight issues with text contrast.
