# [Success Criterion 1.4.5 - Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/images-of-text.html)

Some text such as logo's may be image based, but where possible please make sure to use text elements to display text as this gives the user the flexibility to adapt the size and font to their preference. With React Native, you can use [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text). When designing the UI please make sure not to constrain the height of the Text elements as it will cut off the text when font-scaling is applied. Best is to apply padding or define a minHeight.

```jsx
<Text style={{ minHeight: 16, paddingVertical: 6 }}>Lorem ipsum</Text>
```
