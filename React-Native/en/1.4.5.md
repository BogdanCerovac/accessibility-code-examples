# [Success Criterion 1.4.5 - Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/images-of-text.html)

Make sure to use text elements to display text. With React Native, you can use [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text). When designing the UI please make sure not to constrain the height of the Text elements as it will cut off the text when font-scaling is applied. Best is to apply padding or define a minHeight.

```jsx
<Text style={{minHeight: 16, paddingVertical: 6}}>Lorem ipsum</Text>
```
