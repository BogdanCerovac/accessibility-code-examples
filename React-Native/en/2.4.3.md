# [Success Criterion 2.4.3 - Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html)

In React Native you can use the [`accessible`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessible) prop to indicate that a view should be focusable. The child elements get grouped together.

Unfortunately it's not possible to change the focus order. The official discussion on this topic can be found here: [https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/389](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/389).
