# Success Criterion 2.4.5 - Multiple Ways

When using multiple screens in React Native we recommend using multiple ways to navigate to those screens. For example, create a way for the user to navigate your screens by setting up [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) and use components like [Header buttons](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/header-buttons) and [Tab navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation).

You can also add buttons in your screens to navigate to relevant other screens or implement a search mechanism to find relevant screens.
