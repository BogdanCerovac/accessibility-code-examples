# Success Criterion 2.5.2 - Pointer Cancellation

In React Native there are multiple ways you can listen to a [`PressEvent`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressevent) to detect touches.

Avoid using events like [`onPressIn`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable#onpressin). When using these events, users might not be able cancel a touch. You should use events like [`onPress`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable#onpressin). `onPress` is called after the touch is released, this will give the user the option to cancel unintended actions.

```jsx
<Pressable
  onPress={() => {
    // Do something, after the touch is released
  }}
/>
```
