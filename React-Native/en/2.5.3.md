# Success Criterion 2.5.3 - Label in Name

In React Native you can check if the [`accessibilityLabel`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitylabel) property contains the same name as the name which is shown visually. 

You can test this by searching the code or by using the platform's accessibility tools, [VoiceAccess](https://appt.nl/kennisbank/hulpmiddelen/stembediening/android) for Android and [Voice Control](https://appt.nl/kennisbank/hulpmiddelen/stembediening/ios) for iOS.

```jsx
<Pressable accessibilityLabel="Read more about accessibility">Read more</Pressable>
