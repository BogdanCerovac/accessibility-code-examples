# [Success Criterion 2.5.4 - Motion Actuation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation.html)

In React Native, packages like [expo-sensors](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sensors/) can be used to detect motion.

An event through sensors should not be the only way to trigger actions. Make sure to add a second way, such as a button, to trigger the same action.
