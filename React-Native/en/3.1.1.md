# Success Criterion 3.1.1 - Language of Page

In React Native, there is no standard for loading resources in your desired language. But there are various package available to help you achieve this. This is especially important for users of screen readers.

For example you can use [expo-localization](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/localization) in combination with [i18n-js](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js) to get the device locale and set translations for the app.

```js
import * as Localization from 'expo-localization';
import i18n from 'i18n-js';
// Set the key-value pairs for the different languages you want to support.
i18n.translations = {
  en: { welcome: 'Hello' },
  ja: { welcome: 'こんにちは' },
};
// Set the locale once at the beginning of your app.
i18n.locale = Localization.locale;
```
