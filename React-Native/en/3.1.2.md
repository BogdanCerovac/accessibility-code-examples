# Success Criterion 3.1.2 - Language of Parts

Unfortunately, React Native only has support for changing the language of parts of the content on iOS. You can do this for iOS by setting the [`accessibilityLanguage`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text#accessibilitylanguage-ios).

```jsx
<Text accessibilityLanguage="nl-NL">Appt</Text>
```
