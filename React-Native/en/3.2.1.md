# Success Criterion 3.2.1 - On Focus

In React Native it is possible to listen to focus changes on some components. You can use [`onFocus`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/textinput#onfocus), it gets called when the element is focused. Be careful when the `onFocus` callback: make sure you don't trigger any context changes in the app. This can leave the user confused.

```jsx
<TextInput onFocus={() => {
// Be careful when using onFocus
}} />
```
