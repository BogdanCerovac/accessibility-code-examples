# [Success Criterion 3.2.2 - On Input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-input.html)

In React Native it is possible to listen to input changes on some components. You can use [`onChange`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/textinput#onchange), it gets called when the input of the component changes, for example when you edit text in a text input. Be careful when using the `onChange` callback, make sure no unexpected actions are performed as it is a nativeEvent you are receiving. For TextInput you can use `onChangeText` to simply receive the changed text. 

```jsx
<TextInput onChange={(e) => {
// Be careful when using onChange
}} />
```
TextInput you can use `onChangeText` to simply receive the changed text.
```jsx
import {useState} from "react";
import { TextInput } from "react-native";

const Input = () => {
  const [text, onChangeText] = useState("Dream big");
  const [number, onChangeNumber] = useState(null);

  return (
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        onChangeText={onChangeText}
        value={text}
      />
  );
};
```
