# Success Criterion 3.2.2 - On Input

In React Native it is possible to listen to input changes on some components. You can use [`onChange`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/textinput#onchange), it gets called when the input of the component changes, for example when you edit text in a text input. Be careful when using the `onChange` callback, make sure no unexpected actions are performed.

```jsx
<TextInput onChange={() => {
// Be careful when using onChange
}} />
```
