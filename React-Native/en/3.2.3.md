# [Success Criterion 3.2.3 - Consistent Navigation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/consistent-navigation.html)

We recommend using [React Navigation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation) for navigating between screens in your app. By using React Navigation you make sure you re-use navigation components like the header, tab navigation or drawer navigation on multiple screens.

When creating different screens it's best to run the application and navigate through the screens to check if all navigation is consistent.
