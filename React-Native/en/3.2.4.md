# [Success Criterion 3.2.4 - Consistent Identification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/consistent-identification.html)

In React Native it is recommended to re-use components on multiple screens, this will make sure the behavior of the components is consistent. When using icons, search your app for the icon you're using and check if they have the same behavior and labels. For example when using a cross icon for closing a screen, make sure the label is consistent in all places this icon closes a screen.

```jsx
const CloseButton = () => <Pressable
  accessibilityLabel="Close screen"
>
  <Image
    source={require("icon-close.png")}
  />
</Pressable>
```
