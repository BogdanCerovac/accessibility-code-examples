# Success Criterion 3.3.1 - Error Identification

In React Native there is no standard for indicating errors. You can use the [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component to display an error. Whenever an error occurs, users of assistive technologies should also be able to identify this.

```jsx
<Text>You are required to fill in your e-mail address</Text>
```
