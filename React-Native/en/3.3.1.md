# [Success Criterion 3.3.1 - Error Identification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/error-identification.html)

In React Native there is no standard for indicating errors. You can use the [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component to display an error. Whenever an error occurs, users of assistive technologies should also be able to identify this.

```jsx
<Text>You are required to fill in your e-mail address</Text>
```

You can also use an Alert to indicate Errors that require extra attention.
```jsx
const onError = () => Alert.alert(
    "Oops, something went wrong!",
    "Please try again...",
    [
        {
            text: "Cancel",
            onPress: () => console.log("Cancel Pressed"),
            style: "cancel"
        },
        { text: "OK", onPress: () => console.log("OK Pressed") }
    ]
);
```
