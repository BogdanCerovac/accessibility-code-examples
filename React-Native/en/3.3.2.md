# [Success Criterion 3.3.2 - Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html)

In React Native there is no standard for displaying labels or instructions. You can use the [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component to provide instructions for an input element or to add a label.

```jsx
<TextInput placeholder="Name" value={name} />
<Text>Fill in all the names that you have been given</Text>
```
