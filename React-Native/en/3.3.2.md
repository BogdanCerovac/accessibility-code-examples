# [Success Criterion 3.3.2 - Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html)

In React Native there is no standard for displaying labels or instructions. You can use the [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component to provide instructions for an input element or to add a label.

```jsx
<TextInput placeholder="Name" value={name} />
<Text>Fill in all the names that you have been given</Text>
```

It's also possible to use a package for displaying labels. For example [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/index.html) offers a collection of components for React Native, following Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines. You can use the [TextInput](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/text-input.html) component and use the `label` property.

```jsx
import { TextInput } from 'react-native-paper';

const InputWithLabelComponent = () => {
  return (
    <TextInput
      label="Name"
      value={name}
      onChangeText={text => console.log('Set name')}
    />
  );
};
```
