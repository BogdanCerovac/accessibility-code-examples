# [Success Criterion 3.3.3 - Error Suggestion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/error-suggestion.html)

In React Native there is no standard to suggest solutions. You can use the [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component to display an error solution. Whenever an error occurs and a solution is shown, users of assistive technologies should also be able to identify this.

```jsx
<Text>Invalid date, must be in the form DD/MM/YYYY</Text>
```
