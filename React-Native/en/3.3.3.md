# [Success Criterion 3.3.3 - Error Suggestion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/error-suggestion.html)

In React Native there is no standard to suggest solutions. You can use the [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component to display an error solution. Whenever an error occurs and a solution is shown, users of assistive technologies should also be able to identify this.

```jsx
<Text>Invalid date, must be in the form DD/MM/YYYY</Text>
```
There are third party packages such as [HelperText](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/helper-text.html) that allow you to easily give suggestions to users.

```jsx
<View>
  <TextInput secureTextEntry accessibilitylabel="Please enter your password" value={text} onChangeText={onChangeText} />
  <HelperText type="info" visible={passwordInvalid()}>
    Please make sure your password has at least 8 characters
  </HelperText>
</View>
```
