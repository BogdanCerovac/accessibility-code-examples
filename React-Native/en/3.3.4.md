# Success Criterion 3.3.4 - Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)

In React Native, you can use [Alert](https://reactnative.dev/docs/alert) to confirm transactions. In the Alert prompt it's possible to set the buttons. On [Android](https://reactnative.dev/docs/alert#android) you can add a neutral, negative and positive button, this is based on the amount of buttons that are set. On iOS it's possible to set the [AlertButtonStyle](https://reactnative.dev/docs/alert#alertbuttonstyle-ios) for the listed buttons.

```jsx
Alert.alert(
  "Confirm Appt membership",
  "Your bank account will be billed.",
  [
    {
      text: "Cancel",
      onPress: () => {
        // Cancel
      },
      style: "cancel"
    },
    {
      text: "Proceed",
      onPress: () => {
        // Proceed
      },
    },
  ],
);
```
