Improve the quality of your code with lint checks. React Native comes with a lint tool configured out of the box: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

If possible, always update React Native to the newest version.

Avoid errors with automated testing. Follow the [Testing guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/testing-overview) to get started.
