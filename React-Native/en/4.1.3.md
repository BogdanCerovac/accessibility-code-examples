# [Success Criterion 4.1.3 - Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/status-messages.html)
In React Native you can use the [`announceForAccessibility`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibilityinfo#announceforaccessibility) method from the AccessibilityInfo API. The message you pass to this method will be announced by assistive technologies, such as the screen reader.

```js
AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility('Announcement!');
```
