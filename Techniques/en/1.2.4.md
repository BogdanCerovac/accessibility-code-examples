# Success Criterion 1.2.4 - Captions (Live)
## Android

The challenge with live captions is both organizational and technical. A captioner must be present who can provide live subtitles for the video by using suitable software.

On Android, we recommend using a code library such as [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer). ExoPlayer is developed by Google and is an open-source alternative to Android's [MediaPlayer](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer) for audio and video playback. Many code examples can be found in the [ExoPlayer documentation](https://exoplayer.dev/). You can use [DefaultTrackSelector](https://exoplayer.dev/doc/reference/index.html?com/google/android/exoplayer2/trackselection/DefaultTrackSelector.html) to show subtitles.

```kotlin
val trackSelector = DefaultTrackSelector(baseContext)
trackSelector.setParameters(
    trackSelector.buildUponParameters().setPreferredTextLanguage("nl")
)
val exoPlayer = SimpleExoPlayer.Builder(baseContext)
                    .setTrackSelector(trackSelector)
                    .build()
val dataSourceFactory: DataSource.Factory = DefaultHttpDataSourceFactory(
    Util.getUserAgent(baseContext, "Appt"),
    null,
    DefaultHttpDataSource.DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS,
    1800000,
    true
)
val mediaUri = Uri.parse("https://live.video")
val mediaSource = HlsMediaSource.Factory(dataSourceFactory).createMediaSource(mediaUri)
exoPlayer.prepare(mediaSource)
```
## iOS

On iOS, [AVPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer) has support for [live video](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media_playback_and_selection/using_avfoundation_to_play_and_persist_http_live_streams) with [captions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media_playback_and_selection/adding_subtitles_and_alternative_audio_tracks). Users can [automatically turn on captions](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/subtitles-and-captions-iph3e2e23d1/ios) via System Preferences. The easiest way to stream a live video is through [AVPlayerViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avplayerviewcontroller).

```swift
guard let url = URL(string: "https://live.video") else { return }
let player = AVPlayer(url: url)

let playerViewController = AVPlayerViewController()
playerViewController.player = player

present(playerViewController, animated: true) {
    player.play()
}
```
## Flutter

Currently, there is no support for live captions in the [video_player](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player) package. The issue opened to implement this is [#50595](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/50595).

Other packages, like [better_player](https://pub.dev/packages/better_player), do have support for using captions on live video. See their [documentation](https://jhomlala.github.io/betterplayer/#/README) for extensive information about `better_player`

```dart
BetterPlayerController controller = BetterPlayerController(
    const BetterPlayerConfiguration(
      controlsConfiguration: BetterPlayerControlsConfiguration(
        enableAudioTracks: true,
        enableSubtitles: true,
      ),
    ),
    betterPlayerDataSource: BetterPlayerDataSource.network(
      'https://live.video', 
      liveStream: true,
      useAsmsSubtitles: true,
    ),
  );


@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return BetterPlayer(controller: controller);
}
```
