# Success Criterion 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships
## Android

On Android, you can get a reference to [AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/accessibility/AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat) via [setAccessibilityDelegate](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/ViewCompat#setAccessibilityDelegate(android.view.View,%20androidx.core.view.AccessibilityDelegateCompat)). You can then set information via the following properties:

- [setClassName](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/accessibility/AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat#setClassName(java.lang.CharSequence))
  - Use this method to inherit behavior from an object. For example, set _Button::class.java.name_ if an element should behave like a button.
- [setCollectionInfo](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/accessibility/AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat#setCollectionInfo(java.lang.Object))
  - You can use this method to provide information about collections. For example, setting the number of rows and columns. If you use [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/recyclerview), this will be done for you automatically.
- [setHeading](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/accessibility/AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat#setHeading(boolean))
  - Use this method to set an element as a heading. You can also use the [ViewCompat.setAccessibilityHeading](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/ViewCompat#setAccessibilityHeading(android.view.View,%20boolean)) method.
- [setLiveRegion](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/accessibility/AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat#setLiveRegion(int))
  - Use this method when information on the screen is updated in real-time. The new information is then passed on to assistive technologies. You can also use the [ViewCompat.setAccessibilityLiveRegion](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/ViewCompat#setAccessibilityLiveRegion(android.view.View,%20int)) method.
- [setPaneTitle](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/accessibility/AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat#setPaneTitle(java.lang.CharSequence))
  - Use this method to set pane titles for assistive technologies. You can also use the [ViewCompat.setAccessibilityPaneTitle](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/ViewCompat#setAccessibilityPaneTitle(android.view.View,%20java.lang.CharSequence)) method.

```kotlin
ViewCompat.setAccessibilityHeading(element, true)
ViewCompat.setAccessibilityLiveRegion(
    element,
    ViewCompat.ACCESSIBILITY_LIVE_REGION_ASSERTIVE
)
ViewCompat.setAccessibilityPaneTitle(element, "Appt")
ViewCompat.setAccessibilityDelegate(
    view,
    object : AccessibilityDelegateCompat() {
        override fun onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(
            host: View,
            info: AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat
        ) {
            super.onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(host, info)
            info.className = Button::class.java.name
            info.setCollectionItemInfo(
                AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat.CollectionInfoCompat.obtain(10, 2, true)
            )
            info.isHeading = true
            info.liveRegion = ViewCompat.ACCESSIBILITY_LIVE_REGION_ASSERTIVE
            info.paneTitle = "Appt"
        }
    }
)
```
## iOS

### Info

On iOS, you can use the [accessibilityTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615202-accessibilitytraits) property to provide information to asssistive technologies.

The five most commonly used are: [button](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibility/uiaccessibilitytraits/1620194-button), [header](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibility/uiaccessibilitytraits/1620170-header), [image](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibility/uiaccessibilitytraits/1620174-image), [link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibility/uiaccessibilitytraits/1620178-link), and [selected](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibility/uiaccessibilitytraits/1620197-selected). You can view all possible values at [UIAccessibilityTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibility/uiaccessibilitytraits).

In addition, you can use the [accessibilityValue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615117-accessibilityvalue) to provide values. Finally, you can use the [accessibilityViewIsModal](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615089-accessibilityviewismodal) property to indicate a modal.

```swift
element.accessibilityTraits = [.button]
element.accessibilityValue = "Appt"

viewController.accessibilityViewIsModal = true
```

### Relationships

On iOS, you can use the [isAccessibilityElement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615141-isaccessibilityelement) and [shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615143-shouldgroupaccessibilitychildren) attributes to mark relationships for assistive technologies. Don't forget to set an [accessibilityLabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615181-accessibilitylabel) for the group.

```swift
group.isAccessibilityElement = true
group.shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren = true
group.accessibilityLabel = "Appt"
```
## Flutter

With Flutter, accessibility properties are automatically created for a number of widgets, such as `Slider`, `Button`, `CheckBox` and `TextField`. This ensures that a lot of things work automatically, although it remains important that you also test this.

It is possible to get an overview of all `AccessibilityNodes` by running `flutter run` in the terminal and then typing `S` or `U`. The option `S` gives the order which is used by assistive technologies. The option `U` prints the nodes in an inverse hit-test order.

To make a Flutter app accessible it is important to use the standard Flutter widgets and themes. For example, a `TextButton` automatically has the button property.

When the accessibility properties of a widget do not show the desired behavior, it is possible to supplement or overwrite this. This is possible with the [Semantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html) widget. The most common properties here are `header`, `image`, `link`, `sortKey`, `container` and `excludeSemantics`. The other options are described in [SemanticsProperties](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties-class.html).

- [header](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties/header.html)
  - The `header` property can be used to indicate that all child widgets are a header.

- [image](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties/image.html)
  - The `image` property specifies that all child widgets are an image.

- [sortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties/sortKey.html)
  - `sortKey`  uses a [SemanticsSortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsSortKey-class.html) to sort the elements. The most common way to sort elements is the [OrdinalSortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/OrdinalSortKey-class.html), but you can also write your own implementation based on the `SemanticsSortKey` class.

    The `OrdinalSortKey` needs an `order` as double and an optional String `name`. The elements are then sorted by name first, with empty names handled first, and then by `order`.

    It is also possible not to provide a `sortKey`. In that case, Flutter will generate `OrdinalSortKey`'s based on a platform specific algorithm. This order is often a fairly logical order, but this does not guarantee that it is always right. So always make sure that the sequence is properly tested by means of a screen reader and create a different sequence yourself if necessary.

- [container](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics/container.html)
  - `container` can be used to create a new `SemanticsNode`. This ensures that the information is not merged with parent widgets. This prevents inheriting behavior as Text in a TextButton.  This can also be prevented by setting the `explicitChildNodes` property to `true` in the parent widget.

- [excludeSemantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics/excludeSemantics.html)
  - This property can be used to specify that all child SemanticNodes should be ignored. Considering using [ExcludeSemantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ExcludeSemantics-class.html) when you only need this property. You can also achieve this behavior with [BlockSemantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BlockSemantics-class.html) by removing a previous SemanticsNode.
## React-Native

### Info
In React Native there are multiple properties you can add to your element to give more info about the element:
- [`accessibilityLabel`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitylabel) to give some information about the element, for example a name.
- [`accessibilityHint`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityhint) to help the user understand what will happen after performing an action on the element.
- [`accessibilityRole`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityhint) to set the purpose of the element, for example a button.
- [`accessibilityState`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitystate) to communicate the state of the element to the user, for example if it is disabled.
- [`accessibilityValue`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityvalue) to communicate the current value of the element.

```jsx
<Pressable
  accessibilityLabel="Close"
  accessibilityHint="Close modal"
  accessibilityRole="button"
  accessibilityState={{disabled: true}}
  accessibilityValue={{text: 'Current value'}}
/>
```

### Relations
In React Native it's possible to group elements together to a single selectable element. The property [`accessible`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessible) is used for this. Don't forget to add information to this element to communicate to the user what it is, for example with the [`accessibilityLabel`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitylabel).

```jsx
<View accessible accessibilityLabel="Text component">
  <Text>text one</Text>
  <Text>text two</Text>
</View>
```

Note: by default, all touchable elements are accessible.## Xamarin

By using Effects it is possible to provide information and relationships to assistive technologies.

```csharp
using System;
namespace Project.Common.Effects
{
    [Flags]
    public enum A11YControlTypes
    {
        None = 0,           
        Button = 1,      // Behave as Button
        Toggle = 2,      // Behave as Toggle
        Link = 4,        // Behave as Link
        Header = 8,      // Add role Header
        LiveUpdate = 16, // Announce text changes
        MenuItem = 32    // Behave as MenuItem
    }
}
```

### LiveUpdate example

By using the `A11YControlTypes.LiveUpdate` all changes of `ErrorText` are announced on Android & iOS.

```xml
<Label effects:A11YEffect.ControlType="LiveUpdate"
    Text="{Binding ErrorText}"
    AutomationProperties.IsInAccessibleTree="True" />
```

### Header example

Assigning an `A11YControlType` to an element can be done in several ways. For example, the `A11YControlType.Header` can be added in two ways:

1. Through a Style
2. Add effect to element in XAML file

Example of Style:

```xml
<Style>
    <Setter Property="effects:A11YEffect.ControlType" Value="Header" />
    <Setter Property="AutomationProperties.IsInAccessibleTree" Value="True" />
</Style>
```

Example of XAML:

```xml
<Label effects:A11YEffect.ControlType= "Header" />
```

See [A11YEffect](./A11YEffect.md) for implementation details.
