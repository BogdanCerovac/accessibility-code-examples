# Success Criterion 1.4.2 - Audio Control
## Android

A best practice is to always provide a pause or stop button when sound is playing.

On Android, MediaPlayer has methods to [start](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer#start()), [pause](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer#pause()) and [stop](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer#stop()).

```kotlin
button.setOnClickListener {
    if (player.isPlaying()) {
        player.pause() // Or: player.stop()
    } else {
        player.start()
    }
}
```

Tip: make sure that sound is played through the correct channel. Use the [AudioManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager) for this. The following channels are available:

- [STREAM_ACCESSIBILITY](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_ACCESSIBILITY): channel for accessibility, such as assistive technologies
- [STREAM_ALARM](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_ALARM): channel for alarms
- [STREAM_DMTF](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_DTMF): channel for dual-tone multi-frequency signaling, such as phone dialing tones
- [STREAM_MUSIC](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_MUSIC): channel for music
- [STREAM_NOTIFICATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_NOTIFICATION): channel for notifications
- [STREAM_RING](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_RING): channel for incoming phone calls
- [STREAM_SYSTEM](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_SYSTEM): channel for system sounds
- [STREAM_VOICE_CALL](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#STREAM_VOICE_CALL): channel for voice calls
## iOS

A best practice is to always provide a pause or stop button when sound is playing.

On iOS, [AVPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer) has methods to to [play](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer/1386726-play) and [pause](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer/1387895-pause).

```swift
@objc private func click(_ sender: UIButton) {
    if player.timeControlStatus == .playing {
        player.pause()
    } else {
        player.play()
    }
}
```

Tip: Make sure that sound is played through the correct channel. Use [AVAudioSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession) in combination with [AVAudioSessionCategory](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosessioncategory) for this.

The following channels are available:

* [AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosessioncategoryambient): use this channel if the sound is not important for the functioning of the app
* [AVAudioSessionCategoryMultiRoute](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosessioncategorymultiroute): use this channel if you are sending the sound to multiple output devices at the same time
* [AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosessioncategoryplayandrecord): use this channel for sound recording and playback
* [AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosessioncategoryplayback): use this channel to play recorded music and other sounds that are important for the app's functioning
* [AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosessioncategoryrecord): use this channel for sound recording; other sound is muted
* [AVAudioSessionCategorySoloAmbient](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosessioncategorysoloambient): the default channel to play sound
## Flutter

A best practice is to always provide a pause or stop button when sound is playing.

To play sound in Flutter a package is needed, there are a few options out to chose from, but [just_audio](https://pub.dev/packages/just_audio) is by far the most popular.

The `AudioPlayer` class has functions for both starting and pausing the audio, being `play()` and `pause()`.

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: Icon(Icons.play_arrow),
  iconSize: 64.0,
  onPressed: player.play,
);
/// or
IconButton(
  icon: Icon(Icons.pause),
  iconSize: 64.0,
  onPressed: player.pause,
);
```
