# Success Criterion 1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum)

## Android

When designing an app, take the contrast ratio of all text into account. The contrast ratio of text should be at least 4,5:1, or 3:1 for large text.

You can take a screenshot of the app to determine colors and calculate contrast.

## iOS

When designing an app, take the contrast ratio of all text into account. The contrast ratio of text should be at least 4,5:1, or 3:1 for large text.

You can take a screenshot of the app to determine colors and calculate contrast.

## Flutter

When designing an app, take the contrast ratio of all text into account. The contrast ratio of text should be at least 4,5:1, or 3:1 for large text.

You can take a screenshot of the app to determine colors and calculate contrast using an online contrast calculator, as there are no plugins or tools to check this with using Flutter.

## React Native

Having sufficient text contrast ratio in an app is extremely important and very simple to achieve. Designers will usually take this into account when designing the app. The contrast ratio of text should be at least 4,5:1, or 3:1 for large text.

You can manually test the contrast of your app with [XCode's Accessibility Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/OSXAXTestingApps.html) and Android's [Accessibility Scanner](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/testing#accessibility-scanner). 

Android also offers a very useful [Pre-Launch Report](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/testing#pre-launch-report) that will highlight issues with text contrast.

## Xamarin

Visual Studio for Xamarin does not include tools to calculate contrast. Tools such as [WebAim's Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) can be used to check if colors have sufficient contrast.
