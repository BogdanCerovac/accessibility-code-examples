# Success Criterion 2.2.1 - Timing Adjustable
## Android

On Android, the [Toast](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast) object is often used to temporarily display a message. The length of time may be too short for people to read or hear the message.

We recommend displaying messages by using an [AlertDialog](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/appcompat/app/AlertDialog) or [Snackbar](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/snackbar/Snackbar). Add a close button to let users choose when to close the message.

Also check whether [Executors](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/Executors), [Handler](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler) or [Timer](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Timer) are used somewhere. If there are time limits, make sure they are extendable.

```kotlin
val snackbar = Snackbar
    .make(view, "Message", Snackbar.LENGTH_INDEFINITE)
    .setAction("Close") {
        // Close
    }
snackbar.show()
```
## iOS

On iOS, there is no equivalent for `Toast`, so third-party code libraries are often used. Unfortunately, accessibility is not often thought of. We therefore recommend showing messages via a [UIAlertController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uialertcontroller), with a close button.

Also check whether [DispatchQueue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue) is used somewhere. If there are time limits, make sure they are extendable.

```swift
let alert = UIAlertController(
  title: nil, 
  message: "Message", 
  preferredStyle: .alert
)

alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Close", style: .default, handler: { action in
  // Close
}))

present(alert, animated: true)
```
## Flutter

With Flutter, a [SnackBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SnackBar-class.html) is often used to provide users with some information. The message might be displayed for a too short period of time for users to read or hear the message.

We recommend displaying messages by using an [AlertDialog](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AlertDialog-class.html) with a close button, or to add a close button to the `Snackbar` and set the duration to infinite.

Also make sure that the use of time limits, e.g. by using `Future.delayed()`, throughout the application are extendable.

```dart
ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(
  duration: const Duration(days: 365),
  content: Text('Message'),
  action: SnackBarAction(
    label: 'Close',
    onPressed: () {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).hideCurrentSnackBar();
    },
  ),
));
```
