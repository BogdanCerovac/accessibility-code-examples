# Success Criterion 2.3.1 - Three Flashes or Below Threshold

## Android

On Android, flashing content often uses [Executors](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/Executors), [Handler](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler), or [Timer](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Timer). Check if these objects are used to show more than three flashes per second.

If your app contains any videos, also check if these contain more than three flashes per second.

## iOS

On iOS, flashing content often uses [DispatchQueue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue). Check if this object is used to show more than three flashes per second. Also check if more than three flashes per second are shown in videos.

## Flutter

With Flutter, flashing content often uses widgets that change on changes from a [Stream](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Stream-class.html), e.g. by using a [StreamBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StreamBuilder-class.html), and thus requesting a re-draw of certain parts of the screen. Check if these objects are used to show more than three flashes per second.

If your app contains any videos, also check if these contain more than three flashes per second.

## React Native

Rapidly flashing images or views (more than 3 flashes per second) can cause seizures in some users. For instance this can happen with a progressbar animation that changes color on every update. Please make sure this is not the case when designing and developing the app.
