# Success Criterion 2.4.3 - Focus Order
## Android

On Android, you can use the [android:focusable](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#attr_android:focusable) attribute to accept or reject focus. You can use the methods [setTraversalAfter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityNodeInfo#setTraversalAfter(android.view.View)) and [setTraversalBefore](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityNodeInfo#setTraversalBefore(android.view.View)) of [AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityNodeInfo) to set the focus order of assistive technologies. The methods [setAccessibilityTraversalAfter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setAccessibilityTraversalAfter(int)) and [setAccessibilityTraversalBefore](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setAccessibilityTraversalBefore(int)) provide easier access on API 22 and higher.

The [android:nextFocusForward](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#attr_android:nextFocusForward) method can also be useful to set the next element to move focus to.

For keyboards you can set the focus order in multiple directions:

- [android:nextFocusUp](https://developer.android.com/training/keyboard-input/navigation#:~:text=the%20following%20attributes%3A-,android%3AnextFocusUp,-android%3AnextFocusDown): specify which element should receive focus when navigating up
- [android:nextFocusDown](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#attr_android:nextFocusDown): specify which element should receive focus when navigating down
- [android:nextFocusLeft](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#attr_android:nextFocusLeft): specify which element should receive focus when navigating to the left
- [android:nextFocusRight](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#attr_android:nextFocusRight): specify which element should receive focus when navigating to the right

```kotlin
field2.setAccessibilityTraversalAfter(field1.id)
field3.setAccessibilityTraversalBefore(field4.id)
```

```xml
<View
    android:id="@+id/notFocusable"
    android:focusable="false"/>

<EditText
    android:id="@+id/field1"
    android:focusable="true"
    android:nextFocusForward="@+id/field2"
    android:nextFocusDown="@+id/field3"
    android:nextFocusRight="@+id/field2"
</EditText>

<EditText
    android:id="@+id/field2"
    android:focusable="true"
    android:nextFocusForward="@+id/field3"
    android:nextFocusDown="@+id/field4"
</EditText>

<EditText
    android:id="@+id/field3"
    android:focusable="true"
    android:nextFocusForward="@+id/field4"
</EditText>

<EditText
    android:id="@+id/field4"
    android:focusable="true"
</EditText>
```
## iOS

On iOS, you can use the [isAccessibilityElement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615141-isaccessibilityelement) to allow assistive technologies to focus on elements.

You can adjust the order of navigation via the [accessibilityElements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615147-accessibilityelements) attribute.

The [accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/3043551-accessibilityrespondstouserinter) attribute can be used to optimize keyboard navigation and switch control.

```swift
field1.isAccessibilityElement = true
field2.isAccessibilityElement = true
field3.isAccessibilityElement = true
field4.isAccessibilityElement = true

imageView.isAccessibilityElement = true
imageView.accessibilityLabel = "Appt"
imageView.accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction = false

view.accessibilityElements = [field1, field2, imageView, field3, field4]
```
## Flutter

For sorting the focus order in Flutter apps, the `sortKey` parameter of [Semantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties-class.html) is used.

This parameter uses a [SemanticsSortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsSortKey-class.html) to sort the elements. The most common way to sort elements is the [OrdinalSortKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/OrdinalSortKey-class.html), but you can also write your own implementation based on the `SemanticsSortKey` class.

The `OrdinalSortKey` needs an `order` as double and optionally a `name` as String. The elements are then sorted by name, with empty names handled first, and subsequently by `order`.

It is also possible to not provide a `sortKey`. In this case, Flutter will generate `OrdinalSortKey`'s based on a platform specific algorithm. This order is often a fairly logical order, but this does not guarantee that it is always right. Always make sure to verify the the sequence with assistive technologies such as the screen reader.
## React-Native

In React Native you can use the [`accessible`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessible) prop to indicate that a view should be focusable. The child elements get grouped together.

Unfortunately it's not possible to change the focus order. The official discussion on this topic can be found here: [https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/389](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/389).
## Xamarin

Changing the order of traversal is possible in Xamarin Forms via `TabIndex`. The default value is 0. The value of 0 is seen as more important than a higher TabIndex value. Thus, the order of creation determines the order of traversal.

```xml
    <Label Text="Enter the value for the first entry" />
    <Entry x:Name="firstEntry" />
    <Label Text="Enter the value for the second entry" />
    <Entry x:Name="secondEntry" />
    <Label Text="Enter the value for the third entry" />
    <Entry x:Name="thirdEntry" />
    <Button x:Name="cancelButton" TabIndex="20" />
    <Button x:Name="saveButton" TabIndex="10"/>
```

In the example above the traversal sequence is:

1. Start at *firstEntry*
2. Go to *secondEntry*
3. Go to *thirdEntry*. The *TabIndex* of 0 is considered more important than the 10 of *saveButton*.
4. Go to *saveButton*. The *TabIndex* of 10 is lower than the 20 from *cancelButton*.
5. Go to *cancelButton*. The TabIndex has the highest value.
