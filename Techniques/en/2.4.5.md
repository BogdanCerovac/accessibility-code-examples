# Success Criterion 2.4.5 - Multiple Ways
## Android

We suggest to create components which you can re-use on multiple screens. We recommend using [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments) for each screen.
## iOS

On iOS, you can use [Container View Controllers](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/ImplementingaContainerViewController.html), among other things, to reuse views in multiple places.
## Flutter

We suggest creating separate [Widgets](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Widget-class.html) for reusable content. This makes it easier to create multiple ways to reach a piece of content.
## Xamarin
