# Success Criterion 2.5.2 - Pointer Cancellation
## Android

On Android, you should [OnClickListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.OnClickListener) because it allows cancellation. Avoid using theÂ [OnTouchListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.OnTouchListener). Users will not be able to cancel a touch, unless you implement additonal methods.
## iOS

On iOS, you can use [UIControlEvenTouchUpInside](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrolevents/uicontroleventtouchupinside) to detect touches.

 Avoid using [touchesBegan](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621142-touchesbegan) or [UIControlEventTouchDown](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrolevents/uicontroleventtouchdown). When using these events, users might not be able cancel a touch.
 ## Flutter

When using a [GestureDetector](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html) in Flutter avoid using the `onDown`, like `onTapDown` and `onLongPressDown`, listeners as the user will not be able to cancel the touch. Instead, use the `onAction` methods, like `onTap` or `onLongPress`, as these will give the user the option to cancel unintended actions.
## Xamarin

In Xamarin Forms you can add Listeners in CustomRenderers for Android and/or iOS by using [CustomRenderers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/custom-renderer/).

Make sure not to use the down event for actions.
