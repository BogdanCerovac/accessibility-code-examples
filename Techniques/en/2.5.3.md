# Success Criterion 2.5.3 - Label in Name
## Android

On Android, you can check if the [contentDescription](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:contentDescription) property is equal to the visual name.

You can do this in the code, or you can enable [VoiceAccess](https://appt.nl/kennisbank/hulpmiddelen/stembediening/android). Elements must be activatable by using the name which is shown visually.
## iOS

On iOS, you can check if the [accessibilityLabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615181-accessibilitylabel) property is the same as the name which is shown visually. You can do this in the code, or you can enable [Voice Control](https://appt.nl/kennisbank/hulpmiddelen/stembediening/ios). Users must be able to activate elements with their visible name.
## Flutter

With Flutter, you can check if the [Semantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html) [label](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsProperties/label.html) is equal to the visual name.


It is also advised to use the `onTap`, or other listeners, callback in [Semantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html) to handle the same logic as its child. This will handle the semantic equivalent of a tap action.

The correct usage can be tested by using the platform's accessibility tools, [VoiceAccess](https://appt.nl/kennisbank/hulpmiddelen/stembediening/android) for Android and [Voice Control](https://appt.nl/kennisbank/hulpmiddelen/stembediening/ios) for iOS.
