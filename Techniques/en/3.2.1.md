# Success Criterion 3.2.1 - On Focus

## Android

On Android, be careful when using [OnTouchListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.OnTouchListener). Implementations often have a side-effect of activating elements accidentally.

## iOS

On iOS, you should avoid using [touchesBegan](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621142-touchesbegan) and [UIControlEventTouchDown](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrolevents/uicontroleventtouchdown). When using those, it might be possible to activate elements by accident.

## Flutter

With Flutter, be careful when using a [GestureDetector](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html). Specifically when using the `down` actions, like `onTapDown`, `onLongPressDown`, the implementation can have the side-effect of activating elements accidentally.

## React Native

In React Native it is possible to listen to focus changes on some components. You can use [`onFocus`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/textinput#onfocus), it gets called when the element is focused. Be careful when the `onFocus` callback: make sure you don't trigger any context changes in the app. This can leave the user confused.

```jsx
<TextInput onFocus={() => {
// Be careful when using onFocus
}} />
```
