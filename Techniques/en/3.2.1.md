# Success Criterion 3.2.1 - On Focus
## Android

On Android, be careful when using [OnTouchListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.OnTouchListener). Implementations often have a side-effect of activating elements accidentally.
## iOS

On iOS, you should avoid using [touchesBegan](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621142-touchesbegan) and [UIControlEventTouchDown](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrolevents/uicontroleventtouchdown). When using those, it might be possible to activate elements by accident.
## Flutter

With Flutter, be careful when using a [GestureDetector](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html). Specifically when using the `down` actions, like `onTapDown`, `onLongPressDown`, the implementation can have the side-effect of activating elements accidentally.
