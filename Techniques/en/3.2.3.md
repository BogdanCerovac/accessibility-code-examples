# Success Criterion 3.2.3 - Consistent Navigation
## Android

For Android, Android Studio offers the possibility to see where an icon is used.

Go to your `menu` folder and check wether each `menu file` follows the same order for actions.
## iOS

For iOS, the easiest way to discover whether the same navigation has been used in Xcode is in your `Storyboard`. Open your Storyboard and verify that the same sequence is used in each screen for actions that occur on multiple screens.
## Flutter

By re-using widgets in multiple scenarios the navigation will be the same across different screens. This is especially true if all views use a same 'base'-widget that contains a [Scaffold](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html). However, when creating different views this should be checked by running the application and navigating to the page.
