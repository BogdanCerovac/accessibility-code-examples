# Success Criterion 3.2.3 - Consistent Navigation

## Android

For Android, Android Studio offers the possibility to see where an icon is used.

Go to your `menu` folder and check wether each `menu file` follows the same order for actions.

## iOS

For iOS, the easiest way to discover whether the same navigation has been used in Xcode is in your `Storyboard`. Open your Storyboard and verify that the same sequence is used in each screen for actions that occur on multiple screens.

## Flutter

By re-using widgets in multiple scenarios the navigation will be the same across different screens. This is especially true if all views use a same 'base'-widget that contains a [Scaffold](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html). However, when creating different views this should be checked by running the application and navigating to the page.

## React Native

We recommend using [React Navigation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation) for navigating between screens in your app. By using React Navigation you make sure you re-use navigation components like the header, tab navigation or drawer navigation on multiple screens.

When creating different screens it's best to run the application and navigate through the screens to check if all navigation is consistent.
