# Success Criterion 3.2.4 - Consistent Identification
## Android

Android Studio offers the possibility to see where an icon is used. Go to your `drawable` folder, right click and select the `Find Usages` option. You can also use the shortcut `Option + F7` on Mac, or `Alt + F7` on Windows.

Check if the actions that the icons execute are the same on each screen. Don't forget to also check the [contentDescription](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:contentDescription).
## iOS

For iOS, you can search an Xcode project for references to an icon. Select the function `Show the Find navigator` at the top left, and search for a term such as `icon_search`.

You can also use the shortcut `Cmd + Shift + F` on Mac, or `Ctrl + Shift + F` on Windows. Then check if the function is the same on each screen. Don't forget to also check the [accessibilityLabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement/1619577-accessibilitylabel).
## Flutter

With Flutter, it is recommended to re-use widgets on multiple screens. When doing this the same widget will have the same behavior on all places it is used.
