# Success Criterion 3.3.1 - Error Identification

## Android

On Android, you can use [TextInputLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/textfield/TextInputLayout) to indicate errors. Use the [setError](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/textfield/TextInputLayout#seterror) method to indicate errors. Don't forget to set [setErrorEnabled](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/textfield/TextInputLayout#setErrorEnabled(boolean)) to `true` first.

```kotlin
input.setErrorEnabled(true)
input.setError("You are required to fill in your e-mail address")
```

## iOS

On iOS, there is no native way to indicate errors. We recommend using an [UILabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilabel). There are also third party libraries available for displaying error messages. Unfortunately, accessibility is often not thought of. We therefore recommend building the interface yourself.

```swift
errorLabel.isHidden = false
errorLabel.text = "You are required to fill in your e-mail address"
```

## Flutter

With Flutter, an [InputDecoration](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/InputDecoration-class.html) on a [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html) can be used to indicate an error by setting the `errorText` property to the text that should be displayed. To remove the error, set the `errorText` to `null`.

```dart
String? errorText;

void emailIsNotEmpty(String? email) {
  setState(() {
    if (email == null || email.isEmpty) {
      errorText = 'You are required to fill in your e-mail address';
    }
    errorText = null;
  });
}

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return TextField(
    onChanged: emailIsNotEmpty,
    decoration: InputDecoration(
        labelText: 'TextField',
        hintText: 'TextField',
        errorText: errorText
    ),
  );
}
```

## React Native

In React Native there is no standard for indicating errors. You can use the [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component to display an error. Whenever an error occurs, users of assistive technologies should also be able to identify this.

```jsx
<Text>You are required to fill in your e-mail address</Text>
```

You can also use an Alert to indicate Errors that require extra attention.
```jsx
const onError = () => Alert.alert(
    "Oops, something went wrong!",
    "Please try again...",
    [
        {
            text: "Cancel",
            onPress: () => console.log("Cancel Pressed"),
            style: "cancel"
        },
        { text: "OK", onPress: () => console.log("OK Pressed") }
    ]
);
```

There are also third party packages such as [HelperText](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/helper-text.html) that allow you to easily give feedback to users on errors states.

```jsx
<View>
  <TextInput label="Email" value={text} onChangeText={onChangeText} />
  <HelperText type="error" visible={hasErrors()}>
    Email address is invalid!
  </HelperText>
</View>
```

## Xamarin

Whenever an error occurs, users of assistive technologies should also be able to identify this. By using the `LiveUpdate` effect, each error is announced.

```xml
<Label
    effects:A11YEffect.ControlType="LiveUpdate"
    Text="{Binding ErrorText}"
    IsVisible="{Binding IsValid}" />
```

See [A11YEffect.LiveUpdate](./A11YEffect.md) and [Android](./A11YEffect_Android.md) or [iOS](./A11YEffect_iOS.md).
