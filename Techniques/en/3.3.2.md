# Success Criterion 3.3.2 - Labels or Instructions

## Android

You can use [TextInputLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/textfield/TextInputLayout) to provide labels and instructions.

Use the [setHelperText](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/textfield/TextInputLayout#setHelperText(java.lang.CharSequence)) method to indicate solutions for errors. Don't forget to set [setHelperTextEnabled](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/textfield/TextInputLayout#setHelperTextEnabled(boolean)) to `true` first.

```kotlin
layout.hint = "Name"

input.setHelperTextEnabled(true)
input.setHelperText("Fill in all of the names that you have been given")
```

## iOS

On iOS, there is no native way to provide labels and provide instructions. We recommend using an [UILabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilabel). There are also third party libraries available for displaying instructions. Unfortunately, accessibility is often not thought of. We therefore recommend building the interface yourself.

```swift
titleLabel = "Name"

helpLabel.isHidden = false
helpLabel.text = "Fill in all the names that you have been given"
```

## Flutter

With Flutter, using an [InputDecoration](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/InputDecoration-class.html) with a [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html) the `helperText` parameter of `InputDecoration` can be used to display instructions for a [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html). An extra boolean can be used to switch between showing and hiding the instruction.

```dart
bool _showHelperText = false;

TextField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    helperText: _showHelperText ? 'Fill in all of the names that you have been given' : null,
  ),
);
```

## React Native

In React Native there is no standard for displaying labels or instructions. You can use the [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component to provide instructions for an input element or to add a label.

```jsx
<TextInput placeholder="Name" value={name} />
<Text>Fill in all the names that you have been given</Text>
```

It's also possible to use a package for displaying labels. For example [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/index.html) offers a collection of components for React Native, following Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines. You can use the [TextInput](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/text-input.html) component and use the `label` property.

```jsx
import { TextInput } from 'react-native-paper';

const InputWithLabelComponent = () => {
  return (
    <TextInput
      label="Name"
      value={name}
      onChangeText={text => console.log('Set name')}
    />
  );
};
```
