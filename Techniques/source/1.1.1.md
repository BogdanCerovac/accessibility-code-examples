### Set label

Moved to [add-accessibility-label.md](../add-accessibility-label.md)

### Additional information

If you want to provide the user with additional information, you can use the property below.

```xml
<Label AutomationProperties.HelpText="Apps should be accessible for everyone" />
```

#### Note

This information should not be essential because users can exclude this information from being read aloud.

On iOS you can turn this off with the following steps: Settings - Accessibility - VoiceOver - Detail Level - Speak Hints.

### Exclude decorative images

With Xamarin Forms you can exclude decorative images from the accessibility tree using the following property:

```xml
<Image AutomationProperties.IsInAccessibleTree="False" />
```
