# Success Criterion 1.4.10 - Reflow

## Android

On Android, you should always put all elements in a [ScrollView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ScrollView) or [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/recyclerview).

- Make sure that none of the heights and widths are set to fixed values.
- Make use of [wrap_content](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewGroup.LayoutParams#WRAP_CONTENT) to allow content to grow in height and width.
- Make sure that the [android:maxLines](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView#attr_android:maxLines) attribute is not used to avoid text truncation.

## iOS

Content should remain visible at all times. On iOS, you should put elements in a [UIScrollView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscrollview), [UITableView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/views_and_controls/table_views) or [UICollectionView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/views_and_controls/collection_views).

- Make sure that heights are never set to fixed values.
- Make use of [self-sizing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uifont/creating_self-sizing_table_view_cells).
- Make sure that the [maxNumberOfLines](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/nstextcontainer/1444531-maximumnumberoflines) attribute is not used anywhere to avoid truncated text.

## Flutter

With Flutter, all elements should be placed in a scalable widget. A [SingleChildScrollView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleChildScrollView-class.html) ensures that the underlying widgets that do not fit on the screen become scrollable.

In addition, it is important to avoid setting `maxLines` anywhere. Also avoid using fixed values for heights, unless the widgets are containd inside a SingleChildScrollView.

Furthermore, use `TextOverflow.visible` with the `overflow` parameter of text fields to ensure that the text is not truncated.

## React Native

The focus of the Reflow Success Criterion is to enable users to zoom in without having to scroll in two directions. 
In React Native your elements should be inside a [ScrollView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview). If the elements don't fit, the view becomes scrollable over the vertical axis so the user can still reach them. Ideally scrolling is only necessary in one direction. This is achievable by having the text reflow over the vertical axis. To do this make sure you don't use fixed heights or widths on elements that have text in them. React Native will automatically make the text reflow over the vertical axis.

Avoid [`numberOfLines`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text#numberoflines) on text elements to prevent the text from being shortened.

```jsx
  <ScrollView
    accessibilityLabel="Scrollable transcript of the video">
    <Text>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
      eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad

    </Text>
  </ScrollView>;
```

## Xamarin

Within Xamarin Forms there are multiple ways to show content by scrolling. Some examples are:

* [CollectionView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/collectionview/): for multi dimensional content
* [ListView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/listview/): for one dimensional content
* [ScrollView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/layouts/scrollview): for static content
* [WebView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/webview): for web content
