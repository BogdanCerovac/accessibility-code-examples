# Success Criterion 1.4.5 - Images of Text

## Android

Make sure to use text elements to display text. On Android, you can use [TextView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView) or any of the classes that inherit from it.

## iOS

Make sure that text elements are always used to display text. On iOS, you can use [UILabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilabel) and [UITextView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextview).

## Flutter

Make sure to use text elements to display text. With Flutter, you can use [Text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html) or [RichText](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RichText-class.html).

## React Native

Some text such as logo's may be image based, but where possible please make sure to use text elements to display text as this gives the user the flexibility to adapt the size and font to their preference. With React Native, you can use [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text). When designing the UI please make sure not to constrain the height of the Text elements as it will cut off the text when font-scaling is applied. Best is to apply padding or define a minHeight.

```jsx
<Text style={{ minHeight: 16, paddingVertical: 6 }}>Lorem ipsum</Text>
```

## Xamarin

Avoid using images to display text. Instead, use [Label](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/text/label).
