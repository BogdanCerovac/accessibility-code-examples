# Success Criterion 2.4.5 - Multiple Ways

## Android

We suggest to create components which you can re-use on multiple screens. We recommend using [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments) for each screen.

## iOS

On iOS, you can use [Container View Controllers](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/ImplementingaContainerViewController.html), among other things, to reuse views in multiple places.

## Flutter

We suggest creating separate [Widgets](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Widget-class.html) for reusable content. This makes it easier to create multiple ways to reach a piece of content.

## React Native

When using multiple screens in React Native we recommend using multiple ways to navigate to those screens. For example, create a way for the user to navigate your screens by setting up [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) and use components like [Header buttons](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/header-buttons) and [Tab navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation).

You can also add buttons in your screens to navigate to relevant other screens or implement a search mechanism to find relevant screens.
