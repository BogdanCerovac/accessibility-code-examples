# Success Criterion 2.5.1 - Pointer Gestures

## Android

On Android, the [GestureDetector](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/GestureDetector) is often used in combination with an [OnGestureListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/GestureDetector.OnGestureListener) to detect gestures.

A gesture should not be the only way to trigger actions. Make sure to add a second way, such as a button, to trigger the same action.

## iOS

On iOS you probably use [UIGestureRecognizer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uigesturerecognizer) in combination with a [UIGestureRecognizerDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uigesturerecognizerdelegate) to detect gestures. A gesture should not be the only way to perform actions. For example, add a button to perform the same action.

## Flutter

With Flutter, it is possible to use a [GestureDetector](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html) to implement actions based on certain gestures made.

However, this should not be the only way to trigger an action. Make sure to add a second way, such as a button, to trigger the same action.
## React Native

In React Native, it is possible to use the [Gesture Responder System](https://reactnative.dev/docs/gesture-responder-system) to implement actions based on certain gestures made.

However, this should not be the only way to trigger an action. Make sure to add a second way, such as a button, to trigger the same action.

## Xamarin

Check if your app makes use of [Xamarin Forms Gestures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/gestures/). If so, provide an alternative.
