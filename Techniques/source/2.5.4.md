# Success Criterion 2.5.4 - Motion Actuation

## Android

On Android, the [SensorManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager) is often used in combination with a [SensorEventListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEventListener) to detect movement.

An event through sensors should not be the only way to trigger actions. Make sure to add a second way, such as a button, to trigger the same action.

## iOS

On iOS, it is common to use the [motionEnded](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621090-motionended) method to detect motion. Using this method, an `event` should not be the only way to perform actions. For example, add a button to perform the same action.

## Flutter

With Flutter, packages like [sensors_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/sensors_plus) can be used to detect movement.

An event through sensors should not be the only way to trigger actions. Make sure to add a second way, such as a button, to trigger the same action.

## React Native

In React Native, packages like [expo-sensors](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sensors/) can be used to detect motion.

An event through sensors should not be the only way to trigger actions. Make sure to add a second way, such as a button, to trigger the same action.
