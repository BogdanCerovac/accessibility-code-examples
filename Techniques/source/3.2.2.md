# Success Criterion 3.2.2 - On Input

## Android

On Android, be careful when using the [TextWatcher](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/TextWatcher) methods. Make sure no unexpected actions are performed.

## iOS

With iOS, be careful when using the [UITextFieldDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextfielddelegate) methods. Make sure no unexpected actions are performed.

## Flutter

With Flutter it is advised to be careful with the implementation of `onChanged` callbacks in widgets like [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html). Prevent that unexpected actions are preformed.

## React Native

In React Native it is possible to listen to input changes on some components. You can use [`onChange`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/textinput#onchange), it gets called when the input of the component changes, for example when you edit text in a text input. Be careful when using the `onChange` callback, make sure no unexpected actions are performed as it is a `nativeEvent` you are receiving. For TextInput you can use `onChangeText` to simply receive the changed text. 

```jsx
<TextInput onChange={(e) => {
// Be careful when using onChange
}} />
```

TextInput you can use `onChangeText` to simply receive the changed text.

```jsx
import {useState} from "react";
import { TextInput } from "react-native";

const Input = () => {
  const [text, onChangeText] = useState("Dream big");
  const [number, onChangeNumber] = useState(null);

  return (
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        onChangeText={onChangeText}
        value={text}
      />
  );
};
```
