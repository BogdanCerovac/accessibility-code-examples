# Success Criterion 3.2.4 - Consistent Identification

## Android

Android Studio offers the possibility to see where an icon is used. Go to your `drawable` folder, right click and select the `Find Usages` option. You can also use the shortcut `Option + F7` on Mac, or `Alt + F7` on Windows.

Check if the actions that the icons execute are the same on each screen. Don't forget to also check the [contentDescription](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:contentDescription).

## iOS

For iOS, you can search an Xcode project for references to an icon. Select the function `Show the Find navigator` at the top left, and search for a term such as `icon_search`.

You can also use the shortcut `Cmd + Shift + F` on Mac, or `Ctrl + Shift + F` on Windows. Then check if the function is the same on each screen. Don't forget to also check the [accessibilityLabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement/1619577-accessibilitylabel).

## Flutter

With Flutter, it is recommended to re-use widgets on multiple screens. When doing this the same widget will have the same behavior on all places it is used.

## React Native

In React Native it is recommended to re-use components on multiple screens, this will make sure the behavior of the components is consistent. When using icons, search your app for the icon you're using and check if they have the same behavior and labels. For example when using a cross icon for closing a screen, make sure the label is consistent in all places this icon closes a screen.

```jsx
const CloseButton = () => <Pressable
  accessibilityLabel="Close screen"
>
  <Image
    source={require("icon-close.png")}
  />
</Pressable>
```
