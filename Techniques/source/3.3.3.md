# Success Criterion 3.3.3 - Error Suggestion

## Android

You can use [TextInputLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/textfield/TextInputLayout) to provide suggestions. Use the [setError](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/textfield/TextInputLayout#seterror) method to indicate solutions for input errors. Don't forget to set [setErrorEnabled](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/textfield/TextInputLayout#setErrorEnabled(boolean)) to `true` first.

```kotlin
input.setErrorEnabled(true)
input.setError("Invalid date, must be in the form DD/MM/YYYY, for example, 01/01/2022")
```

## iOS

On iOS, there is no native way to suggest solutions. We recommend using an [UILabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilabel). There are also third party libraries available to provide solutions. Unfortunately, accessibility is often not thought of. We therefore recommend building the interface yourself.

```swift
errorLabel.isHidden = false
errorLabel.text = "Invalid date, must be in the form DD/MM/YYYY"
```

## Flutter

With Flutter, using an [InputDecoration](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/InputDecoration-class.html) with a [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html) the `errorText` parameter of `InputDecoration` can be used to display errors for a [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html). An extra boolean can be used to switch between showing and hiding the error.

```dart
bool _hasError = false;

TextField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    helperText: _hasError ? 'Invalid date, must be in the form DD/MM/YYYY, for example, 01/01/2022' : null,
  ),
);
```

## React Native

In React Native there is no standard to suggest solutions. You can use the [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component to display an error solution. Whenever an error occurs and a solution is shown, users of assistive technologies should also be able to identify this.

```jsx
<Text>Invalid date, must be in the form DD/MM/YYYY</Text>
```

There are third party packages such as [HelperText](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/helper-text.html) that allow you to easily give suggestions to users.

```jsx
<View>
  <TextInput secureTextEntry accessibilitylabel="Please enter your password" value={text} onChangeText={onChangeText} />
  <HelperText type="info" visible={passwordInvalid()}>
    Please make sure your password has at least 8 characters
  </HelperText>
</View>
```
