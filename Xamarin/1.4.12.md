# Success Criterion 1.4.12 - Text Spacing

Xamarin Forms has a couple of attributes that you can use to make it easier to read the text displayed on some elements.

```xml
<Entry CharacterSpacing="3" Margin="10" Padding="10" />
```

```xml
<Editor CharacterSpacing="3" Margin="10" />
```

```xml
<Label CharacterSpacing="3" Margin="10" Padding="10" />
```

It is also possible to make CustomRenderers for the elements mentioned above to alter other attributes on the native controls as mentioned in the *Android* and *iOS* section.
