For Xamarin Forms there are some attributes you can use to make it easier to read the text displayed on some elements.

```xml
    <Entry CharacterSpacing="3" Margin="10" Padding="10" />
```

```xml
    <Editor CharacterSpacing="3" Margin="10" />
```

```xml
    <Label CharacterSpacing="3" Margin="10" Padding="10" />
```

It is also possible to make CustomRenderers for the elements mentioned above to alter other attributes on the native controls as mentioned in the *Android* en *iOS* section.
