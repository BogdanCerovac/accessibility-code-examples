Changing the order of traversing through the screen is also possible in Xamarin Forms via *TabIndex*. The default value is 0, if not used then the order in which the elements are created will be the order of traversing.

```xml
    <Label Text="Enter the value for the first entry:" />
    <Entry x:Name="firstEntry" />
    <Label Text="Enter the value for the second entry:" />
    <Entry x:Name="secondEntry" />
    <Label Text="Enter the value for the first entry:" />
    <Entry x:Name="thirdEntry" />
    <Button x:Name="cancel" TabIndex="20" />
    <Button x:Name="save" TabIndex="10"/>
```

In the example above the user will start at the *firstEntry* and then go to the *secondEntry* and after that to the *thirdEntry* because they don't contain the *TabIndex* attribute so the value is #0# order of creation is leading.

The *save*-button will be traversed to after the *thirdEntry* because the value of *TabIndex* is lower than the value of the *cancel*-button.
