# Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order

Changing the order of traversal is possible in Xamarin Forms via `TabIndex`. The default value is 0. The value of 0 is seen as more important than a higher TabIndex value. Thus, the order of creation determines the order of traversal.

```xml
    <Label Text="Enter the value for the first entry" />
    <Entry x:Name="firstEntry" />
    <Label Text="Enter the value for the second entry" />
    <Entry x:Name="secondEntry" />
    <Label Text="Enter the value for the third entry" />
    <Entry x:Name="thirdEntry" />
    <Button x:Name="cancelButton" TabIndex="20" />
    <Button x:Name="saveButton" TabIndex="10"/>
```

In the example above the traversal sequence is:

1. Start at *firstEntry*
2. Go to *secondEntry*
3. Go to *thirdEntry*. The *TabIndex* of 0 is considered more important than the 10 of *saveButton*.
4. Go to *saveButton*. The *TabIndex* of 10 is lower than the 20 from *cancelButton*.
5. Go to *cancelButton*. The TabIndex has the highest value.
