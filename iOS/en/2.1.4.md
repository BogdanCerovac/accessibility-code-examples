# Success Criterion 2.1.4 - Character Key Shortcuts

On iOS, the [pressesBegan](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621134-pressesbegan) and [pressesEnded](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621128-pressesended) methods are often used to activate shortcuts. You're better off using [UIKeyCommand](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uikeycommand) to add keyboard shortcuts. By adding [modifierFlags](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uikeymodifierflags) you can be sure that shortcuts are not activated by accident. In addition, the shortcut is also shown when long pressing the command key.

```swift
let find = UIKeyCommand(
    input: "f", 
    modifierFlags: .command, 
    action: #selector(findContent), 
    discoverabilityTitle: "Find content"
)

override var keyCommands: [UIKeyCommand]? {
    return [find]
}

@objc private func findContent() {
    // Logic to find content
}
```
