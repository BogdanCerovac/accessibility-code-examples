# Success Criterion 2.2.1 - Timing Adjustable

On iOS, there is no equivalent for `Toast`, so third-party code libraries are often used. Unfortunately, accessibility is not often thought of. We therefore recommend showing messages via a [UIAlertController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uialertcontroller), with a close button.

Also check whether [DispatchQueue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue) is used somewhere. If there are time limits, make sure they are extendable.

```swift
let alert = UIAlertController(
  title: nil, 
  message: "Message", 
  preferredStyle: .alert
)

alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Close", style: .default, handler: { action in
  // Close
}))

present(alert, animated: true)
```
