# Success Criterion 2.2.2 - Pause, Stop, Hide

Make sure it is possible to pause, stop or hide animations.

On iOS, you can read the [UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibility/1615133-isreducemotionenabled) property. The value is `true` if someone prefers reduced animations. In that case, you should disable or reduce the animations in your app. You can do this, for example, with the [setAnimationsEnabled](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622420-setanimationsenabled) method.

```swift
if UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled {
    UIView.setAnimationsEnabled(false)
}
```
