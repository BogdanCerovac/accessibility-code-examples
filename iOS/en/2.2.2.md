# Success Criterion 2.2.2 - Pause, Stop, Hide

Make sure it is possible to pause or stop movements.

On iOS, you can read the [UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibility/1615133-isreducemotionenabled) property. The value is _true_ if someone prefers to show fewer movements. In that case, you would do well not to show movements and animations in your app. You can do this, for example, with the [setAnimationsEnabled](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622420-setanimationsenabled) method.

```swift
if UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled {
    UIView.setAnimationsEnabled(false)
}
```
