# Success Criterion 2.5.1 - Pointer Gestures

iOS often uses the [UIGestureRecognizer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uigesturerecognizer) in combination with a [UIGestureRecognizerDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uigesturerecognizerdelegate) to detect gestures. A gesture should not be the only way to perform actions. For example, add a button to perform the same action.
