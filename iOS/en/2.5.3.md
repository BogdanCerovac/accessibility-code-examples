# Success Criterion 2.4.5 - Label in Name

On iOS, you can check if the [accessibilityLabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615181-accessibilitylabel) property is the same as the name that is visible. You can do this in the code, or you can enable [Voice Control](https://appt.nl/kennisbank/hulpmiddelen/stembediening/ios). Elements must be able to be activated with the name that is visible.
