# Success Criterion 2.5.3 - Label in Name

On iOS, you can check if the [accessibilityLabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615181-accessibilitylabel) property is the same as the name which is shown visually. You can do this in the code, or you can enable [Voice Control](https://appt.nl/kennisbank/hulpmiddelen/stembediening/ios). Users must be able to activate elements with their visible name.
