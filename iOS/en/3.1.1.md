# Success Criterion 3.1.1 Language of Page

On iOS, you can set the language of an app via the [CFBundleDevelopmentRegion](http://cfbundledevelopmentregion) property. In addition, the [accessibilityLanguage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615192-accessibilitylanguage) attribute of [UIApplication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication) can be used to set the language for tools.
