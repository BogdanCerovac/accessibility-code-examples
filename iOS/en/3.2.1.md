On iOS, you should avoid using [touchesBegan](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiresponder/1621142-touchesbegan) and [UIControlEventTouchDown](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrolevents/uicontroleventtouchdown). When using those, it might be possible to activate elements by accident.
