For iOS, you can search an Xcode project for references to an icon. Select the function `Show the Find navigator` at the top left, and search for a term such as `icon_search`.

You can also use the shortcut `Cmd + Shift + F` on Mac, or `Ctrl + Shift + F` on Windows. Then check if the function is the same on each screen. Don't forget to also check the [accessibilityLabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement/1619577-accessibilitylabel).
