# Success Criterion 3.2.4 - Consistent Identification

For iOS, you can search an Xcode project for references to an icon. Select the function _“Show the Find navigator”_ at the top left, and search for _“icon_search”_ for example. You can also use the shortcut **Cmd + Shift + F** on Mac, or **Ctrl + Shift + F** on Windows. Then check if the function is the same on each screen. Don't forget to also check the [accessibilityLabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement/1619577-accessibilitylabel).
