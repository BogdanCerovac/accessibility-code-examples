# Success Criterion 3.3.1 - Error Identification

On iOS, there is no native way to indicate errors. We recommend using an [UILabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilabel). There are also third party libraries available for displaying error messages. Unfortunately, accessibility is often not thought of. We therefore recommend building the interface yourself.

```swift
errorLabel.isHidden = false
errorLabel.text = "You are required to fill in your e-mail address"
```
