# Success Criterion 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions

On iOS, there is no native way to add labels and provide instructions. We recommend using an [UILabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilabel). There are also _third party libraries_ available for displaying instructions. Unfortunately, accessibility is often not thought of. We therefore recommend building the interface yourself.

```swift
titleLabel = "Name"

helpLabel.isHidden = false
helpLabel.text = "Fill in all the names that you have been given"
```
